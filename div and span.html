		Div stands for divivion.the div elemnent is the most generic block level element 
		Span stands for span. the span element is the super generic inline elemnt.

		since DIV 3 is a block level element it requires it's own line so it's get pushed to the next line to be by itself. Now the spin two tag is sitting inside the div three and since it's an inline element it doesn't cause any more formatting And it just sits right here inside the DIV 3 without requiring a new line.
		<div>***DIV 1: some content ***</div>
		<div>***DIV 2: some content ***</div>
		<span>****SPAN 1: spme content ****</span>
		<div>
			*****DIV 3: Following right after span 1
			<span>****SPAN 2: Inside div 3****</span>
